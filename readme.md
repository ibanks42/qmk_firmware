# This is a custom fork [Keychron's QMK Firmware](https://github.com/Keychron/qmk_firmware)

## Keychron K6

This fork is a similar implementation of [Razer's SnapTap](https://www.razer.com/technology/snap-tap-mode) for the Keychron V6 Knob version.

Modified code can be found in `keyboards/keychron/k6/keymaps/custom/keymap.c`.

You can build this firmware by running the following command `qmk compile -kb keychron/v6/ansi_encoder -km custom`.
